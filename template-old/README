radlib template process README
----------------------------------

This directory contains a sample process structure utilizing radlib.
Type "make" to build then run it by typing "./templated".  This sample
process will initialize two timers set to expire every 5 and 12 seconds
respectively.  It also registers stdin as an IO descriptor so that any
input from the shell will be echoed back to stdout.  It does not run as
a true daemon (see radProcessInit for details) so that stdin can be used
for example purposes.

The purpose of this template is two-fold: first, to demonstrate how a
process is best constructed using radlib (including the state machine), 
and second, to provide an example of the event-driven, multiple stimulus
capabilities of a radlib process.  Obviously the interprocess 
communications capabilities of radlib cannot be demonstrated with one 
process.  Nonetheless, an event handler and a message queue handler are
initialized in this template process and the state handlers have "empty"
cases for events and queue messages.

These files are a good starting point for creating your own processes
using the capabilities of radlib.

To build, execute "make" (gmake for BSDs) from this directory.
